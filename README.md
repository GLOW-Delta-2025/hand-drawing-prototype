# hand-drawing-prototype

We developed a hand gesture-based drawing system using Python, OpenCV, and Cursor AI. The camera detects hand movements, using the index finger for drawing and the number of fingers to determine color. A thumbs-up gesture switches the brush to an emoji.

The system synchronizes with a beamer to project drawings onto a whiteboard.
